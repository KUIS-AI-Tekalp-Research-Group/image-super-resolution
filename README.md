# KUIS AI Lab Research on Image Super-Resolution

This repository provides the recent research projects conducted on image super-resolution (SR) under the supervision of [Prof. A. Murat Tekalp](http://mysite.ku.edu.tr/mtekalp/) aiming to achieve better recovery of high-frequency details and accurate reconstruction of SR images. Image SR is a field of research focusing on the recovery of high-resolution images from low-resolution counterparts.
